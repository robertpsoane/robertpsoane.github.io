<p>
  I am a postgraduate student at the University of Nottingham, currently
  studying for an MSc in Computer Science. I graduated with a BSc (Hons) in
  Mathematics in 2020, having spent three years studying numerical methods and
  applied maths.
</p>
<p>
  I am currently studying various topics in software engineering and artificial
  intelligence, improving my coding skills while further building upon the
  analytical skills developed on my undergraduate degree, and developing
  research skills.
