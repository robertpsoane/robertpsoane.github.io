<p>
I am a postgraduate student at the University of Nottingham, currently studying
for an MSc in Computer Science.  I graduated with a BSc (Hons) in Mathematics 
in 2020, having spent three years studying numerical methods and applied maths.</p>
<p>
I am currently studying various topics in software engineering and artificial 
intelligence, improving my coding skills while further building upon the analytical 
skills developed on my undergraduate degree, and developing research skills.
