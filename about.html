<p>
  I am a Computer Science MSc graduate from the University of Nottingham. I am
  now working as a software developer.
</p>
<p>
  I undertook my MSc after graduating with a BSc (Hons) in Mathematics in 2020,
  having spent three years studying numerical methods, scientific computing and
  applied maths.
</p>
<p>
  In my MSc I studied various topics in software engineering and artificial
  intelligence. I significantly improved my programming skills beyond those
  developed in my previous studies.
