As a piece of coursework for my MSc I produced a Scotch whisky recommender agent in Python. This agent builds a Bag of Words (BoW) model of each whisky's tasting notes. From this model, cosine similarity is used to make recommendations based on a user's input.
This was evaluated via a survey, and at the p=0.05 is an improvement over a baseline random recommender.

This coursework is currently being marked - more details will be posted once this is complete.
