    As a piece of coursework for my MSc I produced a Scotch whisky recommender agent in Python. This agent builds a Bag of Words (BoW) model of each whisky's tasting notes. From this model, cosine similarity is used to make recommendations based on a user's input.
    This was evaluated via a survey, and at the p=0.05 is an improvement over a baseline random recommender.

      Limited attempts have been made to apply AI methods to create recommender
      agents for whiskies. These focus on customer trend data (which this report
      argues is not the best strategy), or predominantly use discrete attributes
      about whiskies (distillery, ABV etc) on which to base their
      recommendations

      This project concerns itself with the specific domain of Scotch. To fully
      understand the problem at hand, a basic understanding of the drink is
      required. In this section I present a brief overview of Scotch, and a

      Overview of Scotch
    </h4>
    <!--l. 7-->
    <p class="noindent">
      Scotch whisky refers to whisky produced in Scotland fulfilling a set of
      legal requirements set by the UK Government. Grains are allowed to malt
      (germinate) to develop their sugars, after which sugars are extracted
      producing a syrup, which is fermented producing a sweet hop-free beer.
      This is distilled in
      <span class="cmti-10x-x-109">pot stills </span>to increase the alcohol
      content making <span class="cmti-10x-x-109">new-make spirit</span>. This
      is matured in oak casks for a minimum of 3 years, prior to bottling. At
      this stage the distiller may choose to dilute the whisky to an ABV of no
      less than 40%
      <span class="cite"
        >[<a href="#XJacques2003">1</a>,&#x00A0;<a href="#XPyke1965">2</a

    <!--l. 16-->
    <p class="noindent">
      The flavours present in Scotch come from a number of sources, in turn
      influencing how various whisky flavour profiles are described. To stop the
      grain germinating, it is heated. Some distilleries use a peat fire to do
      this. This imparts a smokey flavour onto the grain, which carries through
      to the end spirit. This smokey flavour is described as
      <span class="cmti-10x-x-109">peated </span
      ><span class="cite"

      >.
      <!--l. 21-->
    </p>

    <p class="indent">
      Maturation provides another opportunity to add flavour to the drink. Age
      all Scotch in oak casks is resource intensive, and has lead to
      distilleries purchasing used casks from other drinks manufacturers.
      Traditionally the sherry industry has supplied used casks to distilleries.
      More recently, bourbon casks have been used. Any cask which has previously
      held any drink can be used, be it for the entire maturation process, or at
      the end such as a <span class="cmti-10x-x-109">sherry cask finish</span>.
      These all add their own flavours to the drink, which is reflected in
      tasting notes

      In general, Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks require a language

    </h5>
    <!--l. 22-->
    <p class="noindent">
      When dealing with text data, it is not uncommon to have multiple forms of
      the same word. A syntactic model would view the words &#8216;cat&#8217;
      and &#8216;cats&#8217; as two different discrete symbols. A method is
      needed to reduce words to a normal form.
      <!--l. 25-->
    </p>

    <p class="indent">
      Porter <span class="cite">[<a href="#XPorter1980">15</a>]</span> proposed
      an algorithm for removing word suffixes to aim for a normal form, this is
      called <span class="cmti-10x-x-109">stemming</span>. With no semantic
      understanding, the algorithm matches specific suffix patterns and removes
      them until it is unable to.
      <!--l. 29-->
    </p>

    <p class="indent">
      A more semantic approach would be
      <span class="cmti-10x-x-109">lemmatization</span>. Instead of
      algorithmically removing word endings, lemmatization normalises words to a
      real word root - the dictionary form of the word
      <span class="cite">[<a href="#XJayakodi2016">16</a>]</span>. One
      lemmatizer implementation in Python is the WordNetLemmatizer in

      For syntactic methods, keyword extraction (KE) is key. For the purposes of
      this report, a keyword is a word of particular relevance or importance,
      and from which we might extract useful information. KE refers to
      strategies based on which those important words can be ranked, keeping the

      Onesuch method, is Term Frequency Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF).
      This is commonly used with BoW, and is implemented in Scikit-Learn
      <span class="cite">[<a href="#XBarupal2011">18</a>]</span>. TF-IDF is a
      statistic for scoring a words importance based on how frequently they
      occur in a document, and in the dataset

      <!--l. 46-->

    <p class="indent">
      Scoring as such aims to penalise words that occur too frequently across a
      document, boosting scores of words in an individual document which appear
      with disproportionately high frequency.

      Another approach for KE is the use of graph-based ranking methods. These

      example is
      <span class="cmti-10x-x-109">Rapid Automatic Keyword Extraction </span

      (AI) applications to whisky. Coldevin built an agent based whisky
      recommender, choosing to use a CB design
      <span class="cite">[<a href="#XColdevin2005">8</a>]</span>. He built a
      system using specific attributes about the whisky to recommend based on
      consumer likes or dislikes. Omid-Zohoor and Eghtesadi built another such
      hybrid (using both CB and CF) agent
      <span class="cite">[<a href="#XOmidzohoor">7</a>]</span>, however again
      they relied on specific categorical and ratio features. An interesting
      design choice was to recommend on the basis of a user&#8217;s entire
      profile, and the ratings they give. Perhaps unsurprisingly their CB model
      performed poorly with users who gave large numbers of reviews. The more
      reviews the more noise.

    <p class="indent">
      I think an agent would be more effective if it takes specific user
      preferences at a given point in time, and makes a recommendation on that
      basis. Instead of attempting to offer users a whisky which best matches
      all varied whiskies they like, users get recommendations of the style they
      want at the time. This is closer to Coldevin&#8217;s approach.

      Wishart completed what seems to be the only study of whisky which uses NLP
      <span class="cite">[<a href="#XWishart2000">31</a>]</span>. Working with
      industry experts he selected 84 different whiskies and extracted
      descriptors from their tasting notes. These were coded and used to cluster
      the whiskies. These clusters were reviewed and evaluated by industry
      experts. He later proposed a set of 12 flavour dimensions for Scotch
      whisky <span class="cite">[<a href="#XWishart2009">32</a>]</span>.

    <p class="indent">
      While groundbreaking, Whisharts work differs somewhat from that carried
      out in this project. Where Wishart aimed to find key flavours in Scotch,
      working with industry experts, I aim to produce an agent which exhibits
      intelligence as an industry expert by suggesting whiskies, based only on
      their tasting notes.

      It was observed that whiskies which are discontinued tend to be listed
      without a price, whereas those which are out of stock are listed with a
      price. For this reason, simplicity&#8217;s sake, price was taken as an
      indication of stock. Those without a price were still recorded for two
      reasons; users may wish to make recommendations based on liking or
      disliking them, and they add to the corpus of tasting notes.

    <p class="noindent">
      While an online spirits shop may use CF recommenders to recommend products
      based on those being viewed (such as recommending gin to customers who
      like gin etc.), a CF system may fail for recommending whiskies based on
      tastes.

      <!--l. 41-->
    </p>

    <p class="indent">
      It is not unlikely that a whisky drinker may wish to buy two very
      different whiskies in one order, just to compare them, or they might enjoy
      a large range of whiskies. One might like a large variety of whiskies, and
      purchase many different styles frequently. It seems unlikely that the
      shopping habits of whisky enthusiasts is sufficient to recommend a whisky
      based on specific tastes.

      As discussed in section
      <a href="#x1-110003.1.2">3.1.2<!--tex4ht:ref: sssec:gbkwe --></a>,
      co-occurrence graphs can be useful for KE. RAKE is one such method where
      primitive centrality measures are used to rank nodes. Another method uses
      eigencentrality. This steps beyond words which themselves have a high
      co-occurrence and rewards words with significantly edges to words with
      high co-occurrences. This could be a compromise for retaining semantic
      data. While losing full semantic data we are at least stepping beyond
      merely looking at frequencies, selecting descriptors with larger amounts
      of influence across the dataset.

      lemmatizing
    </h5>
    <!--l. 13-->
    <p class="noindent">
      Given whisky&#8217;s specific lexicon, an interesting problem occurs when
      trying to use gerneral purpose lemmatizers. In whisky &#8216;peated&#8217;
      is a verb describing how the grain was processed, and thus the
      &#8216;peaty&#8217; (smokey) flavour has been imparted on the finished
      spirit. In English, peat refers to a natural fuel made from dead plant
      matter, and &#8216;peated&#8217; does not exist
      <span class="cite">[<a href="#Xold">36</a>]</span>. &#8216;Peated&#8217;
      and &#8216;peaty&#8217; should both reduce to &#8216;peat&#8217;, however
      as they are not considered as verbs in WordNet. For this reason a separate
      custom whisky lemmatizer was built.
      <!--l. 20-->
    </p>

    <p class="indent">
      The <span class="cmti-10x-x-109">WhiskyLemmatizer </span>was built on top
      of scikit-learn&#8217;s WordNet lemmatizer
      <span class="cite">[<a href="#XBarupal2011">18</a>]</span>. I manually
      created a dictionary of whisky-specific words and corresponding root
      forms. For each input, the lemmatizer first checks the dictionary. If the
      word is not in the dictionary it then uses scikit-learn&#8217;s
      lemmatizer. As WordNet can be slow, every result from WordNet is cached in
      the dictionary.
      <!--l. 25-->
    </p>

    <p class="indent">
      After experimentation with this WhiskyLemmatizer, words in the cache which
      are mapped to words which further reduce were automatically updated to map
      to the leaf word. A set of stopwords was manually produced in an iterative
      process based on the lemmatizer&#8217;s outputs.

      As over time the lexicon may change, the agent should perform KE with each
      training cycle. KE takes a significant proportion of time for model
      building. For this reason time and accuracy are of equal importance.
      Perfect KE is of little use if it takes forever.

      As is clear, TF-IDF KE took orders of magnitude longer than RAKE and
      eRAKE. Qualitatively evaluating the keywords extracted by RAKE vs eRAKE,
      eRAKE produces more useful keywords. This is perhaps unsurprising, as RAKE
      aims to find keywords from a corpus with both a relatively high frequency
      of each keyword, and a higher frequency of stopwords. By applying it to
      tasting notes it is perhaps being misused. As highlighted in

      have different features characterising them. It is likely that the most
      frequent features are penalised due to stopword potential. It is
      interesting to see that WordNet lemmatizing had little impact in terms of
      which words were extracted.

      For the purpose of sanity checking, and ensuring sufficient information is
      retained in each BoW, k-means clustering was applied on a BoW model based
      on 300 keywords from each KE. The clusters of whiskies in

      There is little difference between TF-IDF and TF-IDF*, apart from Edradour
      being clustered with GlenAllachie and Aberlour (two heavily sherried
      expressions) in TF-IDF*, and Blair Athol. Blair Athol is a relatively
      sherried expression, and thus appearing in a peat heavy cluster
      (Laphroaig, Ardbeg, Talisker) seems strange. It&#8217;s TF-IDF* placement
      seems far more sensible.

      seem strange, this is with the view that a web frontend could be designed
      to send data in JSON formats.

      An SQLite database is used to store all whisky data and models. This is
      included in Python and allows multiple agents to access the data at the
      same time. This also allows one agent to update the models and all other
      agents will use the up to date model. It was observed that SQLite runs
      faster than Pandas
      <span class="cite">[<a href="#Xreback2020pandas">40</a>]</span>, however
      Pandas is still used for some manipulations once data is loaded from the
      database.

      When loaded, the agent checks if there&#8217;s a database. If there
      isn&#8217;t, it is built from the pre-existing

      <span class="cmsy-10x-x-109">~</span>14,000 whiskies. As per the
      requirements, and to ensure the agent&#8217;s autonomy, a method was
      written to fetch new whiskies. If the initial dataset is not present, the
      agent will automatically fetch all data.

      The &#8216;new whiskies&#8217; page on MoM&#8217;s website is parsed and
      each listing is checked to confirm it is Scotch. When each ID is created,
      it is checked against those already in the database. If three consecutive
      listings are already in the database, the agent stops, assuming all new
      products have been included. Sometimes one or two re-stocked whiskies are
      listed in succession. Setting three as the threshold reduces the risk of
      stopping prematurely.

    </h4>
    <!--l. 60-->
    <p class="noindent">
      Despite promising results, it is clear that some recommendations received
      a large range of ratings. The small samples used, both of enthusiasts and
      inputs/recommendations, are far from ideal.
      <!--l. 64-->
    </p>

    <p class="indent">
      On reading the free-text responses, it&#8217;s clear that some
      participants weren&#8217;t confident in their whisky knowledge. Some
      participants hadn&#8217;t followed the instructions, for example one
      participant stated they had penalised recommendations with high prices.
      <!--l. 68-->
    </p>

    <p class="indent">
      A few interesting points were made which are worth considering. One
      participant suggested that the input for ATN1 was contradictory, perhaps
      explaining its low score. This suggests that (as intended) this
      recommender method is not ideal for taking a users entire taste profile,
      rather recommending a whisky to try based on similarity between a small
      number of tried whiskies. It would be interesting to investigate whether
      such a system is possible in the specific case of whisky.
      <!--l. 74-->
    </p>

    <p class="indent">
      Many users pointed out that many recommendations were very niche,
      suggesting an extra filter could be incorporated allowing a user to filter
      out single-cask/independent bottles. This also could have impacted the
      accuracy of participant&#8217;s scores.

    </h3>
    <!--l. 2-->
    <p class="noindent">
      This project sought to investigate whether NLP could be applied to free
      text tasting notes to produce an effective Scotch recommender agent.
      <!--l. 5-->
    </p>

    <p class="indent">
      Acting on an environment consisting of a retailers website, an autonomous
      agent was designed with capacity to maintain an updated language model for
      Scotch whisky. This model can reflect changes in the Scotch lexicon, and
      be applied effectively to recommend whisky on the basis of taste. This
      could have significant positive consequences for whisky buyers.

    <p class="indent">
      Due to the sparsity of the field, there is a wealth of space for
      exploration, with a few suggestions listed in
