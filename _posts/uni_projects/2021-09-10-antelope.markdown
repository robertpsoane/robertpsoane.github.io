# Antelope: Transcript Labelling

Antelope (An NLP Transcript Labelling Program), is an open source system for labelling dialogue transcripts.
While specifically designed for labelling Psychiatric transcript data, Antelope can be used to label any transcripts
with classes defined by an administrator. Antelope's machine learning model recommends turn labels based on user inputs.

Antelope was designed as part of my MSc Project.
