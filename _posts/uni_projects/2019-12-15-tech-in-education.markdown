These were a set of tools using JSXGraph for use in teaching Maths.
These tools were produced as part of a third year university project working towards a BSc.

The tools are as follows:

### Trig graphs

- Demonstrate the link between sin and cos functions and a circle

### Taylor Series

- plots a taylor series for a given function alongside the actual graph

### Double Pendulum

- Simulation of a double pendulum with any sets of initial conditions. Using an implementation of 4th order Runge Kutta method to solve Hamiltons equations

The tools in their submitted form can be found <a href="https://robertpsoane.github.io/javascript-maths-tools/">here</a>
