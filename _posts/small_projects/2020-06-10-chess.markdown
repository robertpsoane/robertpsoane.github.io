As a summer project I decided to build a GUI chess game using pygame.  With the exception of a Checkmate function, the 2 player local game works perfectly.

The intention of this project was to learn pygame, and develop my programming skills, improve at Python, as well as learning a bit about OOP.  For this reason, the programming style develops throughout the project.

I would like to revisit this in future and re-write it in a better style.

A future direction would be adding network functionaliy, and potentially an AI chess engine to play against.
