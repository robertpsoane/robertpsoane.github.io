This simulation of Conway's Game of Life was hacked together over a weekend to
gain exposure to React. It is surprisingly satisfying to sit and play with!

It is still in a very hacked prototype form and there many areas for improvement, however it is quite fun to watch!
See it live <a href="https://robertsoane.me/game-of-life/">here</a>
