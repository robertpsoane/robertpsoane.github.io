This simulation of Conway's Game of Life was hacked together over a weekend to
gain exposure to React. It is surprisingly satisfying to sit and play with!

## The Game of Life

Conway's Game of Life (aka Life) was created by John Conway. The idea is to simulate life in a 2d grid with a set of simple rules:

- A live cell with less than 2 living neighbours dies.
- A live cell with 2 or 3 live neighbours survives.
- A live cell with 4+ live neighbours dies.
- A dead cell with 3 live neighbours comes back to life.

## The Live Game

It is still in a very hacked prototype form and there many areas for improvement, however it is quite fun to watch!
See it live <a href="https://robertpsoane.github.io/game-of-life/">here</a>. The game is being redesigned with more features and a better GUI, however the original can always be found (here)[https://robertpsoane.github.io/game-of-life-v1/] Below is a video demo of the game
