## Arbitrary Links

### Mine

Here are some links to things I've done that might be of interest
- [Ducker](https://ducker.soane.io/) - a Docker TUI I built that got a bunch of GitHub stars
- [Wedding Website](https://wedding.soane.io/) - yes I did do a website for my wedding... yes it is hosted on GitHub Pages... no I didn't make her plan it on Jira... yes we did have a massive excel spreadsheet...
- [University Portfolio](https://portfolio.soane.io/) - a while ago, but this was my portfolio through Uni.  It's still there

### Others
Here are some links to things I've had no involvement in but I thought are worth sharing

- [LGTM Gifs](https://www.lgtmgifs.com/) - this is genuinely one of my favourite websites of the pre-GenAI age.
- [MESBG List Builder](https://v2024.mesbg-list-builder.com/) - one of the best tools I've found on the internet; an open source, local first tool for building army lists for MESBG
