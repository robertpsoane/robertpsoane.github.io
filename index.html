Hello and welcome to my site. I am a recent Computer Science master's graduate from the university of Nottingham, working for as a <em>Graduate Developer</em>.
</p>
<p>
During my studies I posted the occaisional project on this site, as well as some fun side projects.
Some of the more recent projects are listed below, and everything I've posted can be found on the <a href="projects">Projects</a> page.  
A few I found particularly interesting were:
<ul>
    <li>
        <a href="2021/09/10/antelope.html">Antelope</a> - For my MSc project I designed an NLP enhanced transcript labelling system aimed specifically
        at reflective practitioners. (Awaiting grade.)
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="2021/06/15/nlp-whisky-agent.html">Scotch Recommender Engine</a> - An AI Scotch whisky recommender engine. Developed as a piece of coursework for my MSc (graded distinction - 82%).
    </li>
