Hello and welcome to my site. I am a postgraduate student at the University of Nottingham, currently studying for an MSc in Computer Science. 
</p>
<p>
I post some projects from my course, (as well as some I do on the side for fun!) on this site.
Some of the more recent projects are listed below, and everything I've posted can be found on the <a href="projects">Projects</a> page.  
A few I found particularly interesting were:
<ul>
    <li>
        <a href="2020/12/18/Pyfighter.html">Pyfighter</a> - A group project as part of my MSc (ranked second of all games submitted and graded distinction - 89%).
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="2020/10/29/cyber_report.html">A Brief History of Encryption</a> - A report on cyber security as part of my MSc
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="/2020/12/02/Othello_gui.html">Othello</a> - An Othello engine made in pygame.
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="2019/12/15/tech-in-education.html">Simulations to Demonstrate Mathematics</a> - One of my projects for my BSc in Mathematics.  Most interesting was programming a <a href="https://robertpsoane.github.io/javascript-maths-tools/DoublePendulum/DoublePendulumAnyIC.html">simulation of a double pendulum</a> in JavaScript.
    </li>
</ul>
