Hello and welcome to my site. I am a recent Computer Science MSc graduate from the University of Nottingham, working as a <em>Graduate Developer</em>.
</p>
<p>
During my studies I posted the occaisional project on this site, as well as some fun side projects.
Some of the more recent projects are listed below, and everything I've posted can be found on the <a href="projects">Projects</a> page.  
A few I found particularly interesting were:
<ul>
    <li>
        <a href="2021/09/10/antelope.html">Antelope</a> - For my MSc project I designed an NLP enhanced transcript labelling system aimed specifically
        at reflective practitioners. (Awaiting grade.)
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="2021/06/15/nlp-whisky-agent.html">Scotch Recommender Engine</a> - An AI Scotch whisky recommender engine. Developed as a piece of coursework for my MSc (graded distinction - 82%).
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="2020/12/18/Pyfighter.html">Pyfighter</a> - A group project as part of my MSc (ranked second of all games submitted and graded distinction - 89%).

        <a href="2019/12/15/tech-in-education.html">Simulations for teaching mathematics</a> - One of my projects for my BSc in Mathematics.  Most interesting was programming a <a href="https://robertpsoane.github.io/javascript-maths-tools/DoublePendulum/DoublePendulumAnyIC.html">simulation of a double pendulum</a> in JavaScript.
