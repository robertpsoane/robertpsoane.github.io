<h2 id="the-game">The Game</h2>
<p>Pyfighter is an 8-bit side scrolling, infinite level platform game, produced in python using PyGame as part on an MSc by R. Soane, R. Danevicius, and S. Mistry.  Inspired by super street fighter, super smash bros and Mario, they created a customisable and addictive game that gets progressively harder.  Pyfighter was <a src="https://github.com/robertpsoane/py-fighter/blob/master/runner_up_certificate.pdf">ranked second of all games</a> submitted and graded <em>distinction</em> - 89%.</p>

<h4 id="main-menu">Main Menu</h4>
<p>On loading the game, you are met with the main menu.  The play button will lead you to an intro cutscene followed by the game, while settings opens the settings menu.  You can quit game from here, and the about button leads to this web page.</p>
<h4 id="gameplay">Gameplay</h4>
<p>Gameplay is relatively simple, use the WASD keys to move your character and the space bar to attack. When all the characters in the level have been defeated a message will appear that the level is complete, and press e to move to the next level.</p>

<p>The game can be paused by pressing the escape key at any time, which will load the pause menu. From here you can continue gameplay, quit game or quit to main menu.</p>

<p>The score is calculated based on number of health points taken by the character, vs number of health points the character takes. Each point the character takes equates to 1 point, and every 5 health points the character loses loses them 1 point.</p>

<h4 id="settings">Settings</h4>

<p>In the settings menu you can change the key bindings to your preferred set.  To do this simply press the change button next to the corresponding action.  The action text will highlight in red.  Press the key on your keyboard that you would like to set the action to and the binding will be updated.  To change the background track, simply press the music button at the bottom and it will iterate through the available tracks.  To return to the default settings, press the reset button.</p>
