## Hello

I'm Robert (though of course you probably guessed that by the word _"Robert"_ written at the top of this page!). I am a software engineer based in Cambridge, and this is a blog.  Of course, you probably guessed my profession by the monospace font, and you probably guessed that this is a blog by the word "Blog" written underneath the aforementioned "Robert Soane".

I'm not sure what will end up on this site, but it will probably be a mix of odd comments on random things that I expect nobody to read.  Apart from whoever is reading this (assuming there is someone reading this...).
